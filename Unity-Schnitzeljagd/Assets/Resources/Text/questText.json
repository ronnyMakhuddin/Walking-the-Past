It is proven that from 1229 Jews had been living in Munich, though they were harassed and pursued almost constantly. The persecution of Jews came to a first peak during the pest in 1349 and only few returned afterwards. All Jews were expelled from the city by Duke Albert 3rd in 1440 and once again in 1715 by Duke Maximilian Emanuel."
