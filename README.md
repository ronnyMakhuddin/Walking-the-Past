# Walking the Past
Welcome to the 1950s in Munich! Explore the inner city while learning about past events and history of buildings. Experience a location-based game with Augmented Reality minigames on-site and see what the city was like before World War II. 

"Walking the Past" is intended for tourists or people in general that take interest in the historic background of buildings and cities. It aids navigating through the city and offers optional infopoints at certain locations to learn about buildings that are not directly linked to the game so far but have fascinating stories to tell on their own.

Many thanks to [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) for their awesome tool and database to create location-based games in Unity3D!


## Building
* Install Unity 2020.2.2f1
* Build for Android (requires Oreo or higher)

## Access Rights
* GPS Location: The game needs to know about your actual location as this drives the player on the map. Playing without this won't be possible!
* Camera: We use AR minigames at specific locations where the player can see the original shape of the building before World War II.

## Starting the Game
* Visit the Marienplatz in Munich.
* Start the game and follow the instructions!

We hope you enjoy our historic trip through Munich!
